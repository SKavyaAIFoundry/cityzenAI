a little learning is a dangerous thing
a snowball effect
a snowball's chance in hell
a stitch in time saves nine
a storm in a teacup
an apple a day keeps the doctor away
an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure
as right as rain
bolt from the blue
burn bridges
calm before the storm
come rain or shine
curiosity killed the cat
cut the mustard
don't beat a dead horse
every dog has his day
familiarity breeds contempt
fit as a fiddle
fortune favours the bold
get a second wind
get wind of something
go down in flames
haste makes waste
have your head in the clouds
he who laughs last laughs loudest
hear something straight from the horse's mouth
he's not playing with a full deck
he's off his rocker
he's sitting on the fence
it is a poor workman who blames his tools
it is always darkest before the dawn
it takes two to tango
jump on the bandwagon
know which way the wind is blowing
leave no stone unturned
let sleeping dogs lie
like riding a bicycle
like two peas in a pod
make hay while the sun shines
on cloud nine
"once bitten, twice shy"
out of the frying pan and into the fire
run like the wind
shape up or ship out
snowed under
that ship has sailed
the pot calling the kettle black
there are clouds on the horizon
those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
through thick and thin
time is money
"waste not, want not"
we see eye to eye
weather the storm
well begun is half done
when it rains it pours
you can catch more flies with honey than you can with vinegar
"you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink"
you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs
